  createServer sets up an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests. 
  - When a request arrives, Node.js handles it using an event-driven approach.
  - The request object (`req`) comes from Node's event system, sometimes involving the OS.
  - The response object (`res`) is initially empty, except for headers that we define.

      Read the HTML file using `fs.createReadStream()`, which:
      - Creates a readable stream to read `index.html` in chunks.
      - Streams the file content as raw binary data without loading the entire file into memory.
      - Efficient for large files because it reads and sends data progressively.

      `.pipe(res)`:
      - Pipes the readable stream (`fs.createReadStream`) to the writable stream (`res`).
      - Automatically writes chunks of data from the HTML file into the response.
      - `res` acts as a writable stream where the HTML file content is directly sent to the client.
      - The response body is dynamically written, and `res.end()` is automatically called when the stream finishes.

      At this point:
      - `res.headers` contains the headers we set earlier.
      - `res.body` doesnâ€™t exist explicitly in Node.js but is being streamed in real-time.
      - The browser receives and progressively renders the HTML content as chunks arrive.
