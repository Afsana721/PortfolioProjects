            <h2>"Weather Forecasting Through the Ages"</h2>
            <p>The history of weather studies, also called meteorology, dates back to
                ancient civilizations like the Babylonians who used cloud patterns and
                astronomical events to predict seasonal weather changes.</p>

                <h2>Art of Weather Forecasting Began with Early Civilizations</h2>
                <p>The art of weather forecasting began with early civilizations using
                    recurring astronomical and meteorological events to help them
                    monitor seasonal changes in the weather. Around 650 B.C.,
                    the Babylonians tried to predict short-term weather changes based
                    on the appearance of clouds and optical phenomena such as haloes.
                    By 300 B.C., Chinese astronomers had developed a calendar that
                    divided the year into 24 festivals, each festival associated with a
                    different type of weather.</p>

                <h2>Climate Projections for Austin</h2>
                <p><strong>Discover the latest climate projections to understand how climate change will shape the
                        city's future weather patterns.</strong>
                <p>Recent projections for Austin indicate a future with hotter summers, more frequent heatwaves, and
                    fewer cold spells. Rainfall projections are highly uncertain, but the amount of rainfall in our area
                    is expected to remain relatively unchanged. As the climate shifts, we can anticipate more extreme
                    weather, more climate variability, and a slight increase in windy days.

                    These projections have been meticulously calculated and analyzed by a team at the University of
                    Texas at Austin as part of the UT-City Climate CoLab — the first city-specific climate collaborative
                    globally. Experts outlined potential outcomes based on two different emissions scenarios, each fully
                    dependent on human activity — or inactivity — in the face of climate change:

                    "High-emissions scenario" — a situation where emissions from human activities keep increasing
                    rapidly.
                    "Business-as-usual emissions scenario" — a situation where our emissions remain the same as they are
                    now.</p>
